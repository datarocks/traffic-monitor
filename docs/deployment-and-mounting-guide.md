# Deployment and Mounting Guide

{% hint style="danger" %}
Warning: Ensure compliance with all applicable laws and local regulations when installing, mounting, and deploying a traffic monitor, particularly in public spaces. Unauthorized surveillance can lead to legal consequences and infringement of privacy rights. Always consult with legal professionals or local authorities if you are unsure of the requirements.&#x20;

Ensure you are mounting the traffic monitor in an approved area to comply with local regulations, and avoid attaching it to utility poles without proper authorization.

**Safety Note**: When installing the camera, always use proper safety equipment, such as gloves and safety goggles and ladder safety to protect yourself. Ensure that the camera is securely mounted, particularly in public spaces, to prevent tampering or accidental damage. Failure to do so could result in injury or damage to property. Verify that all mounting components are tightly fastened and check for stability to guarantee safe and reliable operation.

## Temporary Deployment

The traffic monitor may work very well at head-height mounted anywhere with an unobstructed view of the roadway.  A sturdy camera tripod works well for this situation.

## Permanent Mounting

### Choose a mounting location

### Angle the camera

This will be dependent on the hardware you have chosen to install:

* The camera needs an unobstructed view of the roadway for the best performance, but it is able to perform object detection anywhere in the frame.
* The radar had a narrower field-of-view (FOV) than most cameras and requires specific angles to the roadway for the most accurate speed measurements.

The object detection model may also act differently with different angles. The generalized model available in the base version works well at a variety of angles, but is particularly suited for an oblique angle that has a good side-view of objects as they pass through the frame. This may be further refined for your particular deployment to increase accuracy and precision of object detection.

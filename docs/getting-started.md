# Getting Started

The traffic monitor requires the [Recommended Hardware](recommended-hardware.md) and [software installation](installation.md) before you can begin capturing roadway data.

There are 2 ways to get started:

* Build It - [Build your own device (DIY)](build-your-own-device-diy.md)
* Buy It - Purchase a pre-built traffic monitor or kit from the Roadway Biome Project (_coming soon_).

# Dev Environment

The Traffic Monitor software is completely open source, so you are welcome to modify your devices to fit your needs. If you think others will benefit from your changes, you are welcome to [join the community](../help-and-faq/where-can-i-get-support.md) and [contribute back](contributing.md)!

The [Traffic Monitor OSS repo](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor) is set up as a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) containing everything to get the TM up and running.

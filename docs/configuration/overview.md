# Overview

Traffic Monitor settings and configuration are stored and controlled locally, on each device.&#x20;

The following configuration files control the most common operations:

* [frigate-config.md](frigate-config.md "mention")
* [#environment-file](node-red-config.md#environment-file "mention")
* [#config-file](node-red-config.md#config-file "mention")

It is recommended to start with a minimal configuration and add to it as needed.

# Frigate Config

Object detection is powered by [Frigate NVR](https://frigate.video/), which provides powerful capabilities for tuning and reviewing events. We are not directly affiliated with the Frigate NVR project.

The default Traffic Monitor Frigate `config.yml` is provided as an example, and will likely require modification, especially if you [build-your-own-device-diy](../build-your-own-device-diy/ "mention") or are using anything besides the default Raspberry Pi camera.

Refer to [Frigate Configuration](https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/) docs for full list of available configuration options and descriptions.

# Welcome

The Traffic Monitor is an open source smart city traffic monitoring software built with commodity hardware to capture holistic roadway usage. Utilizing edge machine learning object detection and Doppler radar, it counts pedestrians, bicycles, and cars and measures vehicle speeds.

Our mission is to **democratize the power of AI tools** and data collection and analysis. That is why the traffic monitor software and hardware are open source and available for anyone to build, modify, improve, and contribute back.

We believe that giving power to individual citizens to collect and share traffic information in their public streets will **improve community safety and quality of life**.

# Welcome

The Traffic Monitor is an open source smart city traffic monitoring software built with commodity hardware to capture holistic roadway usage. Utilizing edge machine learning object detection and Doppler radar, it counts pedestrians, bicycles, and cars and measures vehicle speeds.

The traffic monitor software and hardware are open source and available for anyone to build, modify, improve, and contribute back. We welcome your ideas and contributions at the [Traffic Monitor GitHub](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor) repository!
